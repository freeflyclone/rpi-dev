## rpi-dev

The Raspberry Pi (rpi) is a great platform for embedded development work.  Information about setting up a development environment is widely available, and unfortunately, widely varied.  Here we'll coalesce the essentials into a one-stop site for those looking to follow along.  The project uses git submodules to incorporate preferred 3rd party projects.

### Goals

* Efficient workflow : Cross-compiling on Linux host for fastest possible cycle time of edit-compile-test-repeat.
* Adaptable to all flavors : rpi comes in various flavors, switching between them should be near painless.
* Open source tools : zero cost to any would-be developer, other than download times.
* Educational : Skill learned here more broadly applicable in the industry.
