### Workflow

While the rpi in all it's flavors does many things well, as a serious development platform it comes up short in one key area: iteration speed.  The classic edit-compile-test-repeat cycle is hampered by the use of an SD card as primary storage.  For many end-users this not a concern.  For the hard-core developer, its a nuisance at best and can be extremely annoying. Additionally SD cards are subject to quality differences, have long term read/write issues, and in general can introduce uncertainty in a development environment. Happily, there's a solution: cross-compiling from a Linux development host.
