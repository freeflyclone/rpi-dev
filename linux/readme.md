### linux

This is the root folder for linux-related development for the *Raspberry Pi* (rpi)

There are two aspects to developing for linux/rpi applications:

* Resource constrained - the intent is a small, fast booting linux kerned configured for a particular application
* Desktop centric - Cross compilation for linux/rpi using a standard Linux distribution
